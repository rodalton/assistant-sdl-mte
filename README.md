# Watson Assistant with SDL Machine Translation Edge

### Introduction

Use the code and instructions from this repository to integrate the **SDL Machine Translation Edge** (MTE) service with **Watson Assistant**. Integration is achieved using Watson Assistant [web chat events](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-events) and IBM Cloud functions. We use the web chat `pre:send` and `pre:receive` events to call IBM Cloud Functions actions. The IBM Cloud Functions actions make calls to SDL MTE REST API. We use the quick translation method of the SDL MTE API to translate. 

### Solution Outline

The sequence diagram below outlines the set of calls made between services. Note the split between `pre:send` and `pre:receive` events. `chat lang` refers to the language the end user i.e. the language of the end user when asking questions of Watson Assistant and the language the end user expects to receive replies. `watson lang` is the language used to define intents, entities and ultimately the dialog in Watson Assistant i.e. the language used to train your virtual assistant.

### Pre-requisites
- Access to IBM Cloud account, you can [register for an account here](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) 
- Access to the SDL Machine Translation Edge service

### Steps to Build

#### Cloud Functions

1. Use the `sdl_mte_translate.js` file from this repository to create two IBM Cloud Functions actions. Use one action to translate text from the end user being sent to Watson Assistant and another to translate the text returned from Watson Assistant before it's returned to the end user in the web chat UI. 

2. Update each action with your SDL MTE API Key and the appropriate `languagePairId`. 

3. Finally, allow your Cloud Functions actions to handle HTTP events and expose as a web action. Make a note of the endpoint URL as you'll require this when customising the web chat UI. 

#### Web Chat UI

1. Use the `translate.html` file from this repository to launch a web chat UI that includes custom `pre:send` and `pre:receive` events. 

2. Include details of your assistant and Cloud Functions actions (from the step above) in the file before launching. 

#### Launch
Here's the easy bit, once you launch the web chat UI, your assistant should be fully functional, but in a new language thanks to the SDL MTE service!
